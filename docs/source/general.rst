====================
General Requirements
====================

The DIMS project involves coordination of team members in multiple
locations, multiple time zones, and multiple overlapping areas of
responsibility. In order to communicate, coordinate, maintain momentum of
project development, and meet deliverable requirements of the contract
with the sponsor, all DIMS team members must be able to work asynchronously,
independently, and be responsible for following task prioritization or
asking for direction as necessary.

* Must be familiar with, or be able to quickly learn, the following skills
  and tools:

  + Software development using the `Agile methodology`_ and `Scrum methodology`_

  + Use of `Git`_ and related tools for source control management (SCM)

      + Using `GitHub`_, and *hub-flow* (`hub`_ and `git-flow`_)
        following the `Vincent Dreisen branching workflow`_

      + Handling merge conflicts from the command line with tools like
        ``vimdiff``, or graphical user interface tools like
        `gitk`_, `kdiff3`_, or `meld`_.


  + The concepts of `Continuous Integration`_ and `DevOps`_ (also known as
    *agile system administration* or *agile operations*) for rapid development,
    testing, and release of a functional system

  + The concepts of *test and evaluation* using *unit tests*, *functional
    tests*, *acceptance tests*, and *regression tests*

  + `FosWiki`_ (and its version of wiki mark-up)

* Must be able to document your work before, during, and after tasks.

  + `Sphinx`_, `ReStructured Text (reST)`_, and `ReadTheDocs`_ are the
    tools used in the DIMS project

  + `LaTeX`_ experience preferred for peer-reviewed publications
    and posters

  + Microsoft Office products also used

* Must be able to perform independent research on tasks required
  for DIMS development as directed and present findings in both
  written form and live demonstrations (including demos via Adobe
  Connect.)

* Must be able to follow prioritized tasking using a `Jira Agile`_ ticketing
  system, and either (a) complete tasks within a 2-week development
  iteration (a.k.a., *sprint*) cycle, or (b) coordinate with the PI or scrum
  master to re-prioritize and/or break up overly-large tasks before the end
  of sprints.

* General understanding of networking concepts (e.g., the *client/server*
  model, `Domain Name System (DNS)`_ naming, the role of a Virtual Private
  Network (VPN) for remote access, etc.)

* Familiarity with *information security* related concepts (both *attack* and
  *defense*) including, *Trojan horses*, *social engineering*, *malware*,
  *incident response*, etc. (The kinds of things listed in `General Computer
  Security Awareness`_)
